 Tree Tagging (extreme) 1st draft

This is the very first draft of a tagging system. On the back-end, it'll use a self-referencing table in SQL. In the controllers, it'll allow some users to only view tags, and other users will perform CRUD functions on tags. On the front-end, REACT will make it pretty.
